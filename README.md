# Disc List Scout: Music Discovery

## Description

Disc List Scout is a Python-based application designed to help the way music enthusiasts discover new tunes. It allows users to input an album title, then scours user-curated lists on platforms like Discogs and RateYourMusic to compile a Spotify playlist. This tool aims to provide a unique and personalized music discovery experience.
