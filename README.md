# Disc List Scout: Music Discovery

## Description

Disc List Scout is a Python-based application designed to help the way music enthusiasts discover new albums. The way it does this is by allowing users to input an album title, then scouring user-curated lists on platforms like Discogs and RateYourMusic to compile, or add to an existing, Spotify playlist.

## Motivation

I personally love scouring lists of others wherein an album I love lives; however the process of manually adding a song to a "to listen" list is tedious to say the least. I listen to music constantly while programming or doing other work/hobbies. And I always want to find new music, so I wanted to create a solution that could make finding new albums to give a listen easy.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Requests, Flask
- **APIs**: Spotify API

## Planned Features

- **Album Search**: Enter an album name to find related user lists.
- **List Aggregation**: Pull relevant lists from music websites.
- **Playlist Creation**: Automatically add tracks to a Spotify playlist.

## Getting Started

_This section will be updated with installation, configuration, and usage instructions as the project develops._
